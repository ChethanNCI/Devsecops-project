    <p>
      The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War began in February 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia occupied and annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas War. These first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents and cyberwarfare. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. The war has resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.<br>

      In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the Revolution of Dignity and the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, pro-Russian unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops occupied Crimea. Russia soon annexed Crimea after a highly disputed referendum. In April 2014, Russian-backed militants seized towns in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) as independent states, starting the Donbas war. Russia covertly supported the separatists with its own troops, tanks and artillery, and Ukraine failed to fully retake the territory. In February 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk II agreements to end the conflict, but they were never fully implemented in the years that followed. The Donbas war settled into a violent but static conflict between Ukraine and the Russian and separatist forces, with many brief ceasefires but no lasting peace and few changes in territorial control.<br>
      Beginning in 2021, there was a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders, including within neighbouring Belarus. Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. Russia's president Vladimir Putin expressed irredentist views and denied Ukraine's right to exist. He demanded that Ukraine be barred from ever joining the NATO military alliance. In early 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states.<br>
      On 24 February 2022, Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarize and denazify" Ukraine, claiming Russia had no plans to occupy the country. The Russian invasion that followed was internationally condemned; many countries imposed sanctions against Russia, and sent humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. In the face of fierce resistance, Russia abandoned an attempt to take Kyiv in early April. From August, Ukrainian forces began recapturing territories in the north-east and south. In late September, Russia declared the annexation of four partially-occupied provinces, which was internationally condemned. Since then, Russian offensives and Ukrainian counteroffensives have gained only small amounts of territory. The invasion has also led to attacks in Russia by Ukrainian and Ukrainian-backed forces, among them a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. Russia has repeatedly carried out deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians far from the frontline.The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into war crimes and issued arrest warrants for Putin and several other Russian officials.

    <h2>International Support for Ukraine</h2>
    <p>As of March 2024, nations—mostly, Western governments—have since January 2022 pledged more than $380 billion in aid to Ukraine, including nearly $118 billion in direct military aid from individual countries. The United Nations has also pledged $1.7 trillion in aid to Ukraine since Jan.<br>
The aid has mostly been co-ordinated through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, whose 57 member countries include all 32 member states of NATO. The European Union and its members have provided the most aid in total (military, financial and humanitarian), while the United States has by far provided the most military aid.<br>
The United States and other donor countries have hesitated to provide or have imposed limits on the use of some advanced weapons—typically, forbidding Ukraine to use them to strike targets inside Russian territory, a bid to ward off the war's escalation.Since June 2024, they have lifted some of these restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike Russian military targets near the border in self-defense.<br>
The Russian government has condemned the supply of military aid to Ukraine. Russia's president Vladimir Putin said that if military aid stopped, Ukraine would not survive for long.In December 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that if the United States stopped sending military aid, European countries would be unable to provide enough to prevent Ukraine's frontline from collapsing.
